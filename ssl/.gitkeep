# SSL Certificate Directory
# This directory should contain:
#   - fullchain.pem  (SSL certificate + intermediate certificates)
#   - privkey.pem    (SSL private key)
#
# For development: Run ./scripts/setup.sh to generate self-signed certificates
# For production: Use Let's Encrypt via ./scripts/ssl-letsencrypt.sh
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit actual certificates to version control!
